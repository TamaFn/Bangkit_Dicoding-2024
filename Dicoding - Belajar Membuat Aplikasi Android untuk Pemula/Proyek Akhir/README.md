## Description
Apex legend is a battle royale game that I really like now. The gameplay and visuals are very exciting to play with various characters that have unique skills from each other. Then, I have an idea to make an android application by displaying personal data information of the character. Then, my android application was created to complete the submission of learning android dicoding for beginners. I hope you like the application I made even though the results are not very good. You can see the details of each character by clicking on the list provided.This android project uses xml as ui layouting and still stores data locally.
